# MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Networks

This project focuses on using neural networks to tackle the classic problem of MNIST digit classification. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The goal of this project is to build and train a neural network model that can accurately classify these digits.

Project Components:

* Data Preprocessing: The project begins with data preprocessing, which includes loading the dataset, normalizing pixel values, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

* Model Architecture: A neural network model is designed and implemented for digit classification. The architecture typically consists of input, hidden, and output layers, with activation functions, dropout layers, and batch normalization as potential components.

* Training the Model: The neural network is trained using the training dataset. This involves forward and backward passes, optimization (e.g., gradient descent), and adjusting model weights based on the loss function.

* Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a separate testing dataset to measure its accuracy and performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
